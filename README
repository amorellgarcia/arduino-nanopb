Nanopb is a small code-size Protocol Buffers implementation.

Homepage: http://kapsi.fi/~jpa/nanopb/

To compile the library, you'll need these libraries:
protobuf-compiler python-protobuf libprotobuf-dev

The only runtime dependencies are memset() and memcpy().

To run the tests, run make under the tests folder.
If it completes without error, everything is fine.
